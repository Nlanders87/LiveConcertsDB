A project I designed for C# CodeLouisville class. The main function of this program is to allow you to log all of the concerts you attend. 

You will be able to add the artist you watched, the venue, and the date of the concert. It will keep track of every concert in a list.

Upcoming features will be a search funtion, the ability to add pictures and videos of the concert, and the ability to login with a username to store your concerts.
